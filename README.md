# Stock-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the day price direction of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) stock. 
Instead of predicting the actual price, we aim to forecast whether the closing price of the next day will be higher or lower than the opening price.
To achieve profitability in the highly volatile and complex stock market, it is not essential to accurately predict the exact price of a stock. 
Instead, the focus should be on predicting the direction of the price movement â€“ whether it will be higher or lower than the current price. 
By anticipating whether the price will rise, investors can consider buying stocks, while predicting a decline may prompt them to consider selling.
